{"name":"KBuilders","tagline":"Apply Kotlin's type-safe builders everywhere.","body":"It's well-known that Clojure is the preferred back-end language of Level Money. That's all well and good, but here on the Android team, we use [Kotlin](https://www.kotlinlang.org). With its small footprint, low overhead, and _spicy musk_, Kotlin is one of the most compelling JVM languages to come out in years; Type inference, lambdas, extension methods-- it's all in there.\r\n\r\n# Builders Galore\r\nAnother library we use a lot is [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers). I'll spare you the details, but suffice it to say we write a _lot_ of code that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```Java\r\nPerson bilbo = new Person.Builder()\r\n\t.firstName(\"Bilbo\")\r\n\t.lastName(\"Baggins\")\r\n\t.carrying(Arrays.asList(ring, pipe))\r\n\t.weapon(new Weapon.Builder()\r\n\t\t.name(\"Sting\")\r\n\t\t.size(Size.SMALL)\r\n\t\t.detects(Race.GOBLINS)\r\n\t\t.build()\r\n\t.build();\r\n\r\n// And if you want to copy and alter an object:\r\nPerson frodo = new Person.Builder(bilbo)\r\n\t.firstName(\"Frodo\")\r\n\t.build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be great if we could automatically use Kotlin's [typesafe builders](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/type-safe-builders.html) instead?\r\n\r\n# KBuilders\r\n\r\n[KBuilders](https://github.com/Levelmoney/kbuilders) is a code generator that will automatically produce Kotlin builder extensions for all your protocol buffer objects.\r\n\r\nSo now if you want to send your hobbits over the wire, it will look more like this:\r\n\r\n```Kotlin\r\nval hobbit = buildPerson {\r\n\tfirstName = \"Bilbo\"\r\n\tlastName = \"Baggins\"\r\n\tcarrying = listOf(ring, pipe)\r\n\tweapon = buildWeapon {\r\n\t\tname = \"Sting\"\r\n\t\tsize = Size.SMALL\r\n\t\tdetects = Race.GOBLINS\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n// FRODOCOL BUFFERS\r\nval frodo = buildPerson(hobbit) {\r\n\tfirstName = \"Frodo\" \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\nTo use KBuilders, just grab the [latest JAR](https://github.com/Levelmoney/kbuilders/releases/download/0.9/kbuilders.jar)\r\n```bash\r\njava -jar kbuilders.jar --javaRoot=<root of java proto files> --kotlinRoot=<root of destination kotlin files> [--inline] [--methodPrefix=<prefix>]\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck out our [README](https://github.com/Levelmoney/kbuilders/blob/master/README.md) for more details.\r\n\r\n`KBuilders` supports both Google and Wire protocol buffers, as well as most generic Builder implementations.
